#A1. Important Resources
##The companion website
This document is part of an effort to increase the consciousness with which C# developers do their daily job on a professional level. The original version of the document can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/CSharpGuidelines/releases).

In addition to the most up to date version of the original version of this document, you'll find:

- A companion quick-reference sheet
- Visual Studio 2010/2012 Rule Sets for different types of systems.
- [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/) layout configurations matching the rules in chapter 10.
- A place to discuss C# coding quality.

##Useful links
In addition to the many links provided throughout this document, I'd like to recommend the following books, articles and sites for everyone interested in software quality - digital copies of a number of the recommendations alongside training videos and other books are available on the Fiscal network on the development or training shares:

* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) (Steve McConnel)  
One of the best books I've ever read. It deals with all aspects of software development, and even though the book was originally written in 2004 you'll be surprised when you see how accurate it still is. I wrote a [review](http://www.continuousimprover.com/2009/07/book-review-code-complete-2nd-edition.html) in 2009 if you want to get a sense of its contents.

* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) ([Robert C. Martin](http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html))  
The book that drove much of the Clean Code movement, clearly lays out the principles of clean code and explains the reasons behind those principles.

* [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) ([Robert C. Martin](http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html))  
Uncle Bob's follow up to Clean Code which has more about how to produce clean code, but covers a wider area looking at how a professional programmer interacts in the wider business.

* [Building Maintainable Software, C# Edition: Ten Guidelines for Future-Proof Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Maintainable-Software-Guidelines-Future-Proof/dp/1491954523/) ([Joost Visser](http://www.cs.ru.nl/J.Visser/))  
This book is available in multiple versions targets at particular languages and is produced by members of the Software Improvement Group. It covers many of the same concepts for producing quality software as the Clean Code movement, but distils it down to ten broad concepts in this relatively short book.

* [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology-ebook/dp/B007WTFWJ6/) ([Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/) and others)  
Regarded as one of the must read books for software developers, this describes the principles behind the refactorings that are available in many development tools, and other techniques that can be used to improve code. Written back in 2000, the principles in the book continue to be applicable to development today.

* [The Art of Agile Development](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675) (James Shore)  
Another great all-encompassing trip through the many practices preached by processes like Scrum and Extreme Programming. If you're looking for a quick introduction with a pragmatic touch, make sure you read James's book.

* [Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202) (Jimmy Nilsson)  
The book that started my interest for both Domain-Driven Design and Test-Driven Development. It's one of those books that I wished I had read a few years earlier. It would have spared me from many mistakes.

* [Jeremy D. Miller's Blog](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/)  
Although he is not that active anymore, in the last couple of years he has written some excellent blog posts on Test-Driven Development, Design Patterns and design principles. I've learned a lot from his real-life and practical insights.

* [LINQ Framework Design Guidelines](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mirceat/archive/2008/03/13/linq-framework-design-guidelines.aspx)  
A set of rules and recommendations that you should adhere to when creating your own implementations of IQueryable.

* [Best Practices for c# async/await](http://code.jonwagner.com/2012/09/06/best-practices-for-c-asyncawait/)  
The rationale and source of several of the new guidelines in this document, written by [Jon Wagner](https://twitter.com/jonwagnerdotcom).
